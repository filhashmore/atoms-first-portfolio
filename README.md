# Atoms-First Portfolio 2026
Hands-on engineer bridging grid power, robotics, and orbital compute bottlenecks

Engineer transitioning from general engineering → power grid + humanoid robotics + orbital infrastructure

## Current Focus (Dec 2025 – Jun 2026)
- Mastering grid interconnection & micro-grid design (ISO queues, IEEE 1547, DER)
- Humanoid robotics control & simulation
- Starship-era payload integration
- Building toward first revenue-generating AI colocation pilot (3.3 path)

## Projects (coming online weekly)
- [ ] 1. [In progress] Simulated humanoid robot optimizing its own micro-grid consumption
- [ ] 2. [Planned] CubeSat-class payload mechanical/electrical integration
- [ ] 3. [Planned] 1–5 MW immersion-cooled AI colocation site model

Watch this space — committing every week.
